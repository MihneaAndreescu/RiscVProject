# RISC-V Assembler and Executor

Welcome to the RISC-V Assembler and Executor project. This system is designed to convert RISC-V assembly code into binary format and execute the binary files, simulating a RISC-V processor environment.

## Project Overview

This project is part of the "Architecture of Computing Systems" course and is aimed at demonstrating the capabilities of an assembler and executor for the RISC-V instruction set architecture. It includes features that allow users to simulate the execution of RISC-V code and query the state of memory and registers dynamically.

## Features

- **RISC-V Assembler**: Converts RISC-V assembly code into binary format.
- **RISC-V Executor**: Executes binary files and simulates a RISC-V processor environment.
- **Memory and Register Query**: Allows querying of memory and register states at any point during the execution.
- **Complex Instruction Handling**: Supports a wide range of RISC-V instructions and complex execution scenarios.
